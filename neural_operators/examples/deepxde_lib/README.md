# DeepXDE Library Examples

This folder contains example scripts that rely on the **official implementation** of the [DeepXDE](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde) library.

These scripts serve as **wrappers**, demonstrating how to integrate DeepXDE capabilities (like `DeepONet` and `MIONet`) into our pipeline. Relying on the official library allows us to:

- Leverage the broad community validation of DeepXDE.
- Focus on our novel pipeline components while using standard implementations for comparison.
- Easily adopt new features and fixes from the DeepXDE team.
