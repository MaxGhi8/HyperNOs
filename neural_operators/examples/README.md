# Examples

This directory provides example scripts demonstrating how to train and configure various neural operators.

## Contents

- **Training Scripts** (`train_*.py`): Standalone scripts for training specific models (e.g., `train_fno.py`, `train_cno.py`, `train_resnet.py`).
- **Ray Tune Scripts** (`ray_*.py`): Scripts configured for hyperparameter optimization using Ray Tune (e.g., `ray_fno.py`, `ray_model_problem.py`).

These examples cover different use cases, including multiple datasets, varying resolutions, and physics-constrained learning.
