# NeuralOperator Library Examples

This folder contains example scripts that rely on the **official implementation** of the [NeuralOperator](https://github.com/neuraloperator/neuraloperator) library.

These scripts serve as **wrappers**, demonstrating how to integrate standard architectures (like `TFNO`) from the official library into our pipeline. By using the official implementations here, we ensure:

- Compatibility with upstream improvements.
- Ease of benchmarking against standard baselines.
- Trustworthiness of the results.
